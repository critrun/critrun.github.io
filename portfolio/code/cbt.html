                    The project started with the idea of essentially making an improved AprilTag. This quickly led to simplification, 
                    like using retro-reflectors and circles to improve accuracy and reliability. This still relied on only using 1 camera to track multiple 
                    retro-reflector discs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing leads to the next and now the trackers are suddenly not just retro-reflectors but also includes an IMU and MCU. Using multiple 
                    cameras they now triangulate the position of the tracker and use the IMU for orientation of the tracker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project moves on to only relying on IMUs for simplicity, and for this good on device magnetometer calibration was one of the major challenges. 
                    Competing projects like SlimeVR relied on the computation power of a desktop computer to calculate the soft- & hard-iron calibration. 
                    After a while I managed with a lot of work run magnetometer calibration completely standalone on our horribly outdated MCU. 
                    The fitting algorithm only took a couple of seconds to fit the calibration matrix deform to the 100 samples.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately due to monetary reasons the project failed to commercialize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project I managed the team as well as programming firmware, researching algorithms, produced the picture and video content, design work as well as community management.
