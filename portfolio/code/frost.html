                <h1>Frost</h1>
                <p>
                    Frost is a work in progress decentralized protocol meant to serve as an alternative to Discord. It's something I've been working on since November 2023. Unfortunately I don't have much time to spend on this project. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It involves writing specs for internet protocols, SQL database, APIs, scaling and so on, I'm definitely learning a lot from working on it. I'm also learning the horrors of just how insanely centralized the internet is around the US. And it has become a personal thing of mine to try and have as little reliance on any centralization as possible, not just for this project but for things in general due to the currently unstable world situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wish I could put more about the project here, but everything is still very early on and things may change, hit me up on <a href="https://signal.me/#eu/hFQC1jV0ziuUDJpP-8-kD6rRxJyE_yy9I1Th5956xVVdmyEIps1IXqSLWSvBeXpD" target="_blank">Signal</a> if you have any questions.
